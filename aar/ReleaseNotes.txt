  Description
  -----------

  This document is updated for every official release of the CAENRFIDLibrary
  and it contains various information specific to this software which can not 
  be found in the User's Manual, available together with the software or on the 
  CAEN web site: www.caenrfid.it.

  What's new in 4.7.0
  -------------------
   - Added ForceAbort method.

  What's new in 4.6.9b
  -------------------
   - Added Untraceble Gen2 method.
   - Added Authorize Gen2 method.

  What's new in 4.6.9
  -------------------
   - Added VCP support (only for USB Host compatible device).
   - InventoryAbort now launch CAENRFIDException (communication error) when 
     abort is not sent by the reader within a certain timeout.
   - Added GetBatteryLevel for reader that supports the auto battery level 
     detection (like qID-mini).
   - Added mamagement methods for Buffered Mode of qID-mini reader: 
     GetBufferedData, GetBufferSize, ClearBuffer.
   - Added two logical source paramenters for inventory with customized cycle
     sessions: inventory count, dwell time and quite time. Added the relative getters 
     and setters too.
   - Added Chile Regulation.

  What's new in 4.6.1
  -------------------
   - Modified the return length of the SL900A_GetLogState.
   - Modified SL900A_GetMeasurementSetup calculation of the sensorvalue. 
   - Added tag's timestamp returned by the reader during EventInventoryTag,
     with all flags combination.
   - Added SL900A_SetLogLimits and SL900A_GetMeasurementSetup methods for
     IDS_SL900A chips.

  What's new in 4.6.0
  -------------------
   - Added South Africa Regulation.
   - Added port targeting management in the Address parameter of the Connect.
     method when specified a TCP connection type.
   - Added PrintScreen method for printscreen-compatible reader.
   - Modified excepted string length in GetReaderInfo.
   - Modified a log print in the EventInventory Thread to avoid potential
     uncaught exception.
   - Deprecated the NXP_ResetReadProtect method with AccessPassword and unde
     precated the one with one password.

  What's new in 4.5.1
  -------------------
  - Reinforced (and modified) GetPacket(short id) to avoid unexpected silent
    exit of the EventInventoryTag thread. Long wait on GetPacket(short id)
    could return a null value to the state machine of the GetFramedTag method
    while it's in the middle of a transition state and causes the 
    EventInventory thread to exit without any advice or Exception.
  - Synchronized the internal's inputStream thread with the Disconnect() 
    method, in order to end this thread before socket.close() is called by 
    the Disconnect() method itself.
    This avoid a strange SIGSEGV (instead of an IOException as expected) 
    launched at reader disconnection on Android 4.2.2 or higher.
  - Added PERU Regulation.
  - Added support for antenna automatch command.
      
  What's new in 4.5.0
  -------------------
  - Upgraded to 4.5.0 for new SDK Release.
  

  What's new in 4.4.2
  -------------------
  - Added two JAPAN regulation STD106 e STD107.
  - Introduced a new implementation of BT Connect:in particular case,
    low level implementation of some bluetooth chipset, could be
    different form others, and Connect may not behave as excepted, so
    any call to library immediately after Connect, takes no effects
    and blocks BT InputStream's thread on reading.
  - Fixed minor bugs in TCP and BT Thread's Inputstream buffer handling.
  - Fixed bugs in synchronous command timeout.
  
  
  What's new in 4.4.1
  -------------------
 - Bug Fixed an input checking on SetTIDLength method.
 - Added a memory banks enumeration in CAENRFIDTag object.

  -------------------
 - Upgraded to 4.4.0 for new SDK Release.


  What's new in 4.3.0
